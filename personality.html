	<p>He is charismatic. Elegant the way he behaves and walks. He is full of charms which allows him to lure people to him to fullfill his desires. Since he is an Emotion Harvester in disguise, he lacks normal personality traits which leads him to be utterly sarcastic and sometimes impolite. In the day time, he works diligently. After work, he relishes to rest at his apartment listening to pure jazz while drinking wine. He canâ€™t go a day without a glass of Malbec. He prepares and goes out at night in his alter form to harvest emotions.
